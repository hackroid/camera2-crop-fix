## 1.0.3

- Add `24.0-20261029-NIGHTLY-fairlady` and `24.0-20261028-NIGHTLY-infiniti` to the exact build allowlist. Native patches, vendor fingerprints and file hash checks are unchanged. The new builds rely on the existing on-device integrity checks; camera behavior testing is pending.

## 1.0.2

- OnePlus 15: correct the telephoto as well. LineageOS exposes it as camera `4` there, and camera `3` is the ultra-wide ([#10](https://github.com/hackroid/camera2-crop-fix/issues/10)). Earlier versions applied the 15T's layout (main `2`, telephoto `3`) to the OnePlus 15, so its telephoto was never corrected and camera `3` always passed through unchanged. The OnePlus 15 ultra-wide is still not corrected. Not device-tested.
- The package carries one native patch per device, and the installer applies the one for the detected device. The OnePlus 15 patch differs from the 15T patch only in three camera-ID instructions. The 15T patch bytes are unchanged.
- `control.sh status` labels the telephoto counter with the device's own camera ID: `changed_id3` on the 15T, `changed_id4` on the OnePlus 15.
- OnePlus 15T: no functional change, so this update is optional. As with any update, reboot after installing it before using Action; running Action in between can latch a fault.

## 1.0.1

- Fix an OTA first-boot false fault: wait up to two minutes for the userdata checkpoint to finish before activating. A pending checkpoint keeps correction off and preserves the existing enable request; it does not latch a permanent fault. If the wait expires, run `on` after boot.
- Manual activation during a pending checkpoint returns a temporary status. Action remains available to pause while boot activation waits.
- Native patch bytes, supported builds and integrity checks are unchanged. Host regression checks cover checkpoint completion, timeout and cancellation; first-OTA-boot device validation is still pending.

## 1.0.0

First stable release. It includes the unreleased 0.4.0-beta.2 changes below, plus APatch support and automatic updates.

- Automatic updates: Magisk and APatch check this module's `update.json` on the stable release channel. Beta users install 1.0.0 manually once.
- APatch 11039 or newer is supported alongside Magisk 30.7 or newer. Not device-tested on APatch. Under APatch, finish module installs, updates and removals with a full reboot, not Soft reboot.
- Uninstalling no longer leaves a persistent fault when the camera service has not started yet.
- Known issue: the first boot after a system OTA can latch a fault when `/data` is remounted for the userdata checkpoint. Check it with `control.sh status` and read [architecture and recovery](https://github.com/hackroid/camera2-crop-fix/blob/main/doc/architecture.md) before clearing it.

Builds and evidence:

Support these official LineageOS builds in one package: OnePlus 15T (PLZ110) `24.0-20261011-NIGHTLY-fairlady`, `24.0-20261014-NIGHTLY-fairlady`, `24.0-20261015-NIGHTLY-fairlady` and `24.0-20261022-NIGHTLY-fairlady`; OnePlus 15 `24.0-20261014-NIGHTLY-infiniti` and `24.0-20261021-NIGHTLY-infiniti`. Each build is accepted only with its own device's vendor fingerprint and camera HAL hash. The native patch source and the camera-service and system camera-library hash checks are unchanged; `camera.qcom.so` is checked against each device's own hash. A listed build with different camera files is still rejected at install and activation.

- fairlady 20261011: device-tested profile.
- fairlady 20261022: camera service and the three checked camera libraries are byte-identical to the 20261011 profile (official OTA). Device-tested after the OTA: unmodified, physical IDs 2 and 3 return crop2 as ratio 1 / 1024×768. With this package they return 2048×1536, the controller reports verified with no fault, and the correction re-arms after reboot.
- fairlady 20261014, 20261015: listed by exact version; their camera files were not extracted, so the on-device hash checks decide.
- infiniti 20261014, 20261021: the camera service, `libcamera_client.so` and `libcamera_metadata.so` are byte-identical to the 15T profile, so the same patch applies. `camera.qcom.so` and the vendor fingerprint are the OnePlus 15's own and are pinned (official OTAs). Not device-tested. The guard corrects only physical rear cameras `2` and `3` that report the 15T's 4096×3072 arrays and 5.59/12.19 mm focal lengths; other results pass through unchanged and status stays at `verified=0`.

## 0.4.0-beta.1

Initial public pre-release for OnePlus 15T (PLZ110), LineageOS `24.0-20261011-NIGHTLY-fairlady` only.

- Correct repeated crop metadata scaling for independently opened physical rear cameras 2 and 3, including quantized 10× and CUSTOM still requests.
- Toggle with Magisk Action; retain the requested state across reboot.
- Validate exact firmware/library identities and disable correction on a detected fault.
- Construct the patched image from the verified installed original; no complete system image is distributed.

Logical-camera automatic lens selection and application post-processing are outside this patch. Install this beta manually; automatic updates start with stable releases.

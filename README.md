# OnePlus 15/15T Camera2 Crop Fix

[简体中文](README-CN.md)

> **Upstream bug tracking:** [LineageOS/issues#853](https://github.com/LineageOS/issues/issues/853)
>
> Follow the upstream report for investigation and resolution status.

A reversible Magisk or APatch module that corrects repeated crop metadata scaling on the **OnePlus 15T (PLZ110)** and **OnePlus 15** with the listed LineageOS builds. It fixes the mismatch between preview and still-photo magnification on independently opened physical rear cameras, including the crop-size failure at 10×.

**Device-tested only on the OnePlus 15T.** OnePlus 15 support has not been tested on a device, and a user reports that it does not fix the problem there ([#10](https://github.com/hackroid/camera2-crop-fix/issues/10)).

**Only the listed build identities are supported.** Other builds are rejected, even if their version names look similar.

## Requirements

| Device | LineageOS |
| --- | --- |
| OnePlus 15T / PLZ110 | `24.0-20261011-NIGHTLY-fairlady`<br>`24.0-20261014-NIGHTLY-fairlady`<br>`24.0-20261015-NIGHTLY-fairlady`<br>`24.0-20261022-NIGHTLY-fairlady`<br>`24.0-20261029-NIGHTLY-fairlady` |
| OnePlus 15 / CPH2745, CPH2747, CPH2749, PLK110 | `24.0-20261014-NIGHTLY-infiniti`<br>`24.0-20261021-NIGHTLY-infiniti`<br>`24.0-20261028-NIGHTLY-infiniti` |

| Component | Supported configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Build ID | `CP2A.260605.016` |
| Camera paths | OnePlus 15T: physical rear camera IDs `2` (main) and `3` (telephoto)<br>OnePlus 15: physical rear camera IDs `2` (main) and `4` (telephoto); ultra-wide `3` is not corrected |
| Root manager | Magisk 30.7, tested; newer versions must pass the same checks. APatch 11039 or newer (Action support), reported working on a OnePlus 15 by a user ([#10](https://github.com/hackroid/camera2-crop-fix/issues/10)) |

The installer and runtime also verify the exact original camera service and camera-library hashes. See [profile.json](profile.json). KernelSU is not supported by this package.

## Install and use

1. Download the module ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/hackroid/camera2-crop-fix/releases), not GitHub's source-code ZIP.
2. Install it in **Magisk → Modules → Install from storage** or **APatch → APModule → Install**, then reboot. Under APatch, use a full reboot, not **Soft reboot**, after installing, updating or removing any module; a Soft reboot that applies module changes turns the correction off with a fault.
3. Close camera applications. Open this module in Magisk or APatch and tap **Action** to enable correction.
4. Tap **Action** again to pause. The requested state is retained across reboot.

`flag=1` means enabled; `flag=0` means paused. `verified=0` means this camera-service process has not yet processed a matching result. `changed_id2` and `changed_id3` (`changed_id4` on the OnePlus 15) count corrected main and telephoto results. An initial activation may restart the camera service; pausing/resuming the same accepted process does not.

First installation stays paused. Updates retain your enable request. Magisk and APatch check for module updates automatically. If you installed a beta, install 1.0.0 manually once to join the update channel.

### Remove or restore

Remove the module in Magisk or APatch and reboot (a full reboot under APatch) to return to the original system image. The module uses a temporary file bind and never writes the system partition.

To restore immediately, close camera applications and run:

```sh
su -mm -c 'sh /data/adb/modules/camera2_native_zoom_fix/control.sh restore'
```

A fault disables correction and blocks automatic retry. System or library updates require a newly validated profile. Read [architecture and recovery](doc/architecture.md) before clearing any fault state.

## Scope

- Corrects guarded crop metadata for independently opened physical rear main and telephoto cameras: IDs `2` and `3` on the OnePlus 15T, `2` and `4` on the OnePlus 15.
- Covers zoom rounding at 10× and supported photo/preview capture intents.
- Preserves the original mapper call and return value.
- Uses native code backed by a verified file; requires no added SELinux rules, Frida, Zygisk or Vector.

Automatic lens selection through logical camera `0`, application lens selection and application post-processing are outside this module's scope. This is not a universal camera or image-quality fix.

## Build and contribute

See the [development workflow](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), [building and testing](doc/building.md) and [release setup](doc/releasing.md). A release ZIP contains a small native patch; the installer reconstructs the camera service from the verified original already on the device. Complete system/vendor binaries, photos and diagnostic logs are not distributed.

Please fork and PR if you want to contribute.
